    The master developing branch. Defaults to master.

 auto_previous_tag

    If enabled, look in the guts of the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag
    plugin in order to find the previous release's tag. This will be then
    compared against the develop_branch. Defaults to false (0).

 release_branch

    The branch recording the releases. Defaults to releases.

 text

    The text before git output. If it is a non-empty string, :<space> will
    be appended. Defaults to code churn.

 skip_file

    A complete path (from the distribution root) that should not be
    included in the statistics. Can be given multiple times.

 skip_match

    A part of a regex used to match against complete paths. Paths that
    match are not included in the statistics. Can be given multiple times.
